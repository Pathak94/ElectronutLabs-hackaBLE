It's designed such that you can use it three ways:\n\n\n\n\nOn a breadboard\n\n\nOn a custom PCB, hand-soldered easily using the castellated 2.54 mm pitch headers\n\n\nOn a custom PCB, using a stencil and oven, making use of extra pads underneath the PCB\n\n\n\n\nhackaBLE uses offers more value than just using the BLE module directly - since it incorporates the necessary passive components - including the ones for the buck converter for power saving - and adds an RGB LED and a button for convenience. It's also much easier to solder than the bare modules. \n\n\nPinout for hackaBLE\n\n\n\n\nPCB Footprint for hackaBLE\n\n\n\n\n(The kicad footprint for hackaBLE is readily available in this repository.)\n\n\nProgramming hackaBLE\n\n\n\n\nhackaBLE uses the Nordic nRF52832 which in turn is based on an ARM Cortex-M4 core. So you can really program it with any ARM compatible programmer. We do have a convenient solution though, in the form \nof our \nBumpy\n blackmagic probe compatible SWD debugger and our \nPogoProg\n. \n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, use the four SWD pins of PogoProg on hackaBLE to upload or debug hackaBLE.\n\n\nPlease \nread the bumpy documentation\n on using Bumpy to program hackaBLE.\n\n\nFor more details on nRF5 2programming, please read our guide on \ngetting started with Nordic nRF5 SDK\n.\n\n\nhackaBLE & Arduino\n\n\nHackable does not ship with a bootloader, but it is supported in arduino. Please see https://github.com/electronut/ElectronutLabs-bluey#Arduino for details (but select Hackable in the boards menu).\n\n\nBuy a hackaBLE!\n\n\nhackaBLE is available for purchase from our \nTindie store\n.
